This repository contains the codes and notes based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07744.
The 'NIUS Project.nb' file contains Mathematica codes for obtaining figures 2, 5, 6 and 7 of the paper.
The 'NIUS_Code.ipynb' Jupyter notebook contains Python codes for obtaining figures 8, 9 and 13 of the paper.
All codes are very self-explanatory, and do not require any special libraries to run.
